# Deep Learning Mini Projects

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Mini Projects** repository! This collection showcases small-scale, practical projects built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and related deep learning tools. Each project demonstrates the application of different neural network architectures and techniques to real-world problems.

## üíª Projects Included

Some example projects you will find here:

1. **Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM**  
   - Predicts future stock prices using previous Open, Low, High, Volume details.  
   - Implements LSTM neural networks with Keras.  
   - Visualizes training progress and predictions.
